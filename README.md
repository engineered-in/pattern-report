# Pattern Report
*Finds what matters - fast.*<br>
*Searches and summarizes recurring text in PDFs.*


When working with large **PDF** documents, itâ€™s hard to find **specific patterns** or details quickly.

**Pattern Report** scans your PDFs for **multiple patterns** at once - like codes, labels, or keywords - and shows you exactly where they appear.

It **reports** each match with its **location** and gives you a clean **page-by-page summary**, making review **faster, easier** and **accurate**.
